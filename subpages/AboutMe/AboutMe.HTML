    <p>My name is Griffin and I am a 9th grade student at Innovation Academy.<br>My interests include rock climbing and video games. The pathways which<br>I have the highest chance of choosing is engineering and IT. This is because<br> I have interests in becoming a game designer, aerospace engineer, and software engineer.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I love to travel to different places and explore different wildlife. For<br>most of my life, I have lived in Colorado, so I enjoy cold weather and<br>mountains. The most important item on my bucket life is to visit every country in the world.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I will definitely not choose the healthcare path as my focus for the rest<br>of highschool as I do not like looking at or even hearing about the<br>insides and function of the human body, though I might encorporate it into engineering if I choose it.</p>
