<h1>About Me</h1>

<body>
    <p>My name is Griffin and I am a 9th grade student at Innovation Academy. My interests include rock climbing and
        video
        games. The pathways which I have the highest chance of choosing is engineering and IT. This is because I have
        interests in becoming a game designer, aerospace engineer, and software engineer.</p>

    <p>I love to travel to different places and explore different wildlife. For most of my life, I have lived in
        Colorado,
        so I enjoy cold weather and mountains. The most important item on my bucket life is to visit every country in
        the
        world.</p>

    <p>I will definitely not choose the healthcare path as my focus for the rest of highschool as I do not like looking
        at
        or even hearing about the insides and function of the human body, though I might encorporate it into engineering
        if
        I choose it.</p>
