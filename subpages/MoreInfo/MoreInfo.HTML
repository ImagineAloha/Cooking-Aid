    <h2>Why should you use this site?</h2>
    <p>
      This website is aimed at an audience of people who either don't want to
      go to the store to buy only a few ingredients or people who can't afford
      a variety of food. The site provides different meals cooked and tested
      by consumers like yourself which can be created with the ingredients
      you already have.
    </p>
    <p>
      This site is meant to help guide you to a healthier life, but that cannot
      be achieved if nobody posts their recipes, so sharing recipes is greatly
      appreciated. This website is completely free, so there is no need to
      sign up for a membership or buy a subscrition. However, if you feel
      that this site is helpful to you, donations are very welcome.
